Resume Points for Face Detection Project
Developed a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar cascades, capable of detecting and highlighting faces in live video feed from a webcam.

Implemented image processing techniques including grayscale conversion and face detection using detectMultiScale() with optimized parameters (scaleFactor, minNeighbors, minSize).

Integrated OpenCV functions for video capture (VideoCapture), frame processing (cvtColor), and visualization (imshow, rectangle).

Ensured clean program termination with proper resource release (release()) and window management (destroyAllWindows()).
